# Efficient GPU-accelerated fitting of observational health-scaled stratified and time-varying Cox models
This repository contains the instructions and files to reproduce the experiments performed in the "Efficient GPU-accelerated fitting of observational health-scaled stratified and time-varying Cox models" paper by Yang et al.


### Reproducing the experiments in Section 3

* `runSyntheticStratCox.R` reproduces the synthetic experiments in Section 3.1.

* `runStratLEGEND.R` reproduces the LEGEND study with stratification in Section 3.2.

* `runTimeVaryingLEGEND.R` explores the LEGEND study with time-varying coefficient in Section 3.3.
